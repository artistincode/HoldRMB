;;;======================= 2.Hotkey and Hotstrings =============================;;;

;^j::
;MsgBox, you pressed control and shift ;;; don't need the curve brackets for keys in MsgBox ;;;

;^j::
;Send, my first script {!} ;;; notice that the ! uses {} for showing the mark, if not, send commond will send Alt key ;;;

;::fyi:: For you information, ;;; a hotstring has a pair of colons on each side of the text you want to trigger the text replacement.
;;the text to replace you typed text goes on the right of the second pair of the colons.

;Esc::
;MsgBox, Escape!!!
;return ;;; trigger {Esc} key to open MsgBox with words Escape!!!;;;

;;;===Hotstring can also launch scripted actions.Hotstring can do pretty much anyting.===;;;

;::press h::
;MsgBox, you triggered MsgBox by using hotstring.
;return 
;;;===notice hotstring can't convert input and scripts same time.===;;;

;^j::
;MsgBox, wow!
;MsgBox, there are
;Run, notepad.exe
;WinActivate, Untitled - Notepad
;WinWaitActive, Untitled - Notepad
;Send, 7 lines{!}{Enter}
;SendInput, inside the CTRL{+}J hotkey.
;return 
;;;= from line 35 to line 39, the scripts open notepad and input in the notepad. ;;;

;:*:ftw:: Free the Whales ;;; the star key in the middle of the first sets of colon will replace the text rightway. More Hotstring
;;modifiers can be found at https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotstrings.htm ;;;


;;;===== windows specific hotkey and hotstrings =====;;;
;;;#IfWinActive
;;;#IfWinExist

;;;this is called "directives", create context-sensitive hotkeys and hotstrings. Simply specify a window title. More advanced can be found
;;; here at https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/misc/WinTitle.htm ;;;

;#IfWinActive Untitled - Notepad
;#SPACE::
;MsgBox, You pressed WIN+SPACE in Notepad.
;return

;#IfWinActive Untitled - Notepad
	;!q::
;MsgBox, You press Alt+Q in Notepad.
;return
;#IfWinActive
	;!q::
;MsgBox, You press Alt+q in any window.
;;;===When #IfWin directives are never used in a script, all hotkeys and hotstrings are enabled for all windows.
;;;The #IfWin directives are positional: they affect all hotkeys and hotstrings physically beneath them in the script. 
;;;They are also mutually exclusive; that is, only the most recent one will be in effect.
;;;more information check link https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/_IfWinActive.htm===;;;


;;;===== multiple hotkey/hotstring per file =====;;;
;;; for hotkeys, don't forget return at the end of each section;;;

;^b::
;Send, {CTRL down}c{CTRL up}
;SendInput, [b]{CTRL down}v{CTRL up}[/b]
;return 
;;= the funciton of this script is when press ctrl b , it will do 2 actions, line 77 it will "copy" any content
;; whatever is selected. line 78 is "paste" with [b] and [/b] at the start and the end of the content. In this case,
;; it will convert the content to bold in BBcode.
;; the script can be tested in https://www.bbcode.org/playground.php =;;;


;;;======================= 3.Sending Keystroks =============================;;;

;;; the Send command literally sends keystrokes, to simulate typing or pressing of keys.;;;
;;; Send command has special keys(rules), which need to be follow. Such as 
;;; !=Alt
;;; +=Shift
;;; ^=Ctrl
;;; #=Windows

;;; more special key built-in to AHK, for example {Enter} and {Space}. Full list can be found here  
;;; https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm ;;;
;;;This table does not apply to hotkeys. Meaning, you do not wrap Ctrl or Enter (or any other key) inside curly 
;;;brackets when making a hotkey.;;;

;;;***Some keys DO need the curly brackets. It's how AHK knows that {!} means "exclamation point" and not "press the Alt key".

;^i::
;Send, Hello world {{}{!}{}}
;;;= try the code above to see if the result is expected, and have fun.=;;;

;^i::
;send, try to press {Enter} key here.
;= another example=;;;

;^!b::
;Send, ^v
;return
;;;= this script will send Ctrl+v when  Ctrl+Alt+b is pressed =;;;  

 ;When making a hotkey...
 ;WRONG
;;;	{LCtrl}::
;Send, AutoHotkey
;return

; CORRECT
;LCtrl::
;Send, AutoHotkey
;return


;;;======================4 Running Programs and Websites==========================;;;

;;; You can suse the Run command to run/launch a programm and open URLs.;;;

;^i::
;Run, https://www.youtube.com
;return 

;;; Note most programs will require a FULL file Path:

;^i::
;Run, C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe
;return

;;; For more advanced function, check the link https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Run.htm ;;;


;;;=====================5 Commands vs. Functions()================================;;;

;;;AHK has tow main types of things used by the scripter to create code: commands and funcitons. ;;;
;;;a list of all can be found link https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/index.htm   ;;;

;;;	Commands Do not use parentheses around the parameters like functions do. So a command would look like this:
;;;*** Command, Parameter1, Parameter2, Parameter3
;;;	Command also differ from function in that they use "legacy syntax". This means that you need percent signs around a variable, 
;;;such as %Var%, and that any text and number do not need to be in quotation marks, such as This is some test. 
;;; you can not do math in the parameters, unlike functions. 

;;;	Functions use parentheres. A typical function looks like:
;;;*** Function(Parameter1, Parameter2, Parameter3)
;;; Function have a few main differences:
;;; 1. You can do math in them:
;;;	substr(37* 12, 1, 2)
;;;	SubStr(A_hour - 12, 2)
;;; 2. Variables do notr need to be wrapped in percent signs:
;;; SubStr(A_Now, 7, 2)
;;; 3. Functions can do inside of functions:
;;; SubStr(A_AhkPath, InStr(A_AhkPath, "AutoHotkey"))
;;; 4. Text needs to be wrapped in quotes:
;;; SubStr("I'm scripting, awesome!", 16)

;;; a function usually return a value differently than a command does. Commands need an OutputVar parameter, functions do not.
;;; The most comon way assigning the value of a function to a variable is like so:
;;; MyVar := SubStr("I'm scripting, awesome!", 16)
;;; See link for more details https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Functions.htm

;;;=====Code blocks=====;;;

;;; link for Code blocks https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Block.htm   ;;;
;;; Code block are lines of code surrounded by little curly brackets {}. They group a section of code together so that AutoHotkey knows it's
;;; one big family and that it need sot stay together. They are most often used with functions and control flow statements such as If and Loop.
;;; Without them, only the first line in the block is called. 


;In the following code, BOTH lines are run only if MyVar equals 5:

;if (MyVar = 5)
;{
    ;MsgBox, MyVar equals %MyVar%!!
    ;ExitApp
;}

;In the following code, the message box is only shown if MyVar equals 5. The script will ALWAYS exit, even if MyVar is not 5:

;if (MyVar = 5)
	;MsgBox, MyVar equals %MyVar%!!
;ExitApp


;^i::
;MsgBox % SubStr("123abc789",7,3)
;return

;;;Note need to review chapter 3,4 and 5.;;;

;;;=================================6 Variables===================================;;;;

;;; Variables are like little post-it notes that hold some information. 
;;; Variable can be assigned a few ways.  Please pay attention to the equal sign (=).

;;; Examples:
;;; MyVar = Text 
;;; MyVar = %MyVar2%   ;; variable assignment.
;;; MyVar = %MyVar2% some text %MyVar3%
;;; MyVar := "Text"

;;; equal signs  (=) with a symbol in front of it such as :=  +=  -=  .=   are called assigment operator. 

;; When to use percents
;When you are using commands (see above), except when the parameter is OutputVar or InputVar.
;When you are assigning a value to a variable using the legacy mode (an equal sign with no symbol in front of it).

;;; More examples 
;;;; Some examples showing when to use percents and when not:
;Var = Text  ; Assign some text to a variable (legacy).
;Number := 6  ; Assign a number to a variable (expression).
;Var2 = %Var%  ; Assign a variable to another (legacy).
;Var3 := Var  ; Assign a variable to another (expression).
;Var4 .= Var  ; Append a variable to the end of another (expression).
;Var5 += Number  ; Add the value of a variable to another (expression).
;Var5 -= Number  ; Subtract the value of a variable from another (expression).
;Var6 := SubStr(Var, 2, 2)  ; Variable inside a function. This is always an expression.
;Var7 = %Var% Text  ; Assigns a variable to another with some extra text (legacy).
;Var8 := Var " Text"  ; Assigns a variable to another with some extra text (expression).
;MsgBox, %Var%  ; Variable inside a command. 
;StringSplit, Var, Var, x  ; Variable inside a command that uses InputVar and OutputVar.
;if (Number = 6)  ; Whenever an IF has parentheses, it'll be an expression. So no percent signs.
	;if (Var != Number)  ; Whenever an IF has parentheses, it'll be an expression. So no percent signs.
		;if Number = 6  ; Without parentheses, the IF is legacy. However, only variables on the 'right side' need percent signs. 
			;if Var1 < %Var2%  ; Without parentheses, the IF is legacy. However, only variables on the 'right side' need percent signs.
